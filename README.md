**MetaArchive is sunset as of 3/31/2025. MetaArchive's code and documentation remains available as an archive of the network's 20 years of operation.**

# [Archived] Welcome to MetaArchive's Public Documentation Wiki!

**[This repository's wiki](https://github.com/MetaArchive/public-documentation/wiki)** contains information for member institutions' data wranglers and content managers, as well as folks from other [Private LOCKSS Networks (PLNs)](https://github.com/MetaArchive/public-documentation/wiki/PLN-%E2%80%90-Private-LOCKSS-Network) who may be interested in how we do things at MetaArchive.

## Contents

Documentation is currently organized into three main areas within the **[Wiki](https://github.com/MetaArchive/public-documentation/wiki)** section of this repository:
* **How MetaArchive Works** -- information about our LOCKSS network, available tools, technical specifications, and who-uses-what at each institution
* **Technical Workflows** -- step-by-step instructions for performing tasks (preparing content for ingest, ingesting content, etc.)
* **Knowledge Base** -- glossary of terms, best practices, and contextual information

### private-documentation
