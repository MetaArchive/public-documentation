A file archiver is a program like 7-Zip, Archive Utility, Tar, or WinZip, that "combines a number of files together into one archive file, or a series of archive files, for easier transportation or storage. File archivers may employ lossless data compression in their archive formats to reduce the size of the archive." (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_archiver)).

The act of creating an "archive file" is called zipping.
