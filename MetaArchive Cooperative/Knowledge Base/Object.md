In most cases, when a MetaArchive member uses the term object or digital object, they are using it synonymously with [Archival Unit](/public-documentation/MetaArchive-Cooperative/Knowledge-Base/Archival-Units-(AUs)). But archival units can also contain multiple objects, depending on how the data wrangler processed the  [collection](/public-documentation/MetaArchive-Cooperative/Knowledge-Base/Collection) for preservation.

An object may be a discrete intellectual entity, such as an archival folder in a collection. An object may be a grouping of multiple discrete entities, such as an archival series. Or an object could even represent an entire collection.Â 

Object can be an ambiguous term, but it's also commonly used and closely related to an archival unit.
