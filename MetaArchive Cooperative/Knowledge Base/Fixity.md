Fixity
======

"**File fixity** is a [digital preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation "Digital preservation") term referring to the property of a digital file being fixed, or unchanged. Fixity checking is the process of verifying that a digital object has not been altered or corrupted. During transfer, a repository may run a fixity check to ensure a transmitted file has not been altered en route. Within the repository, fixity checking is used to ensure that digital files have not been affected by [data rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_rot "Data rot") or other digital preservation dangers. By itself, fixity checking does not ensure the preservation of a digital file. Instead, it allows a repository to identify which corrupted files to replace with a clean copy from the producer or from a backup."

The LOCKSS system uses [polling and voting](/public-documentation/MetaArchive-Cooperative/Knowledge-Base/Polling-and-Voting) to ensure fixity of ingested AUs.
