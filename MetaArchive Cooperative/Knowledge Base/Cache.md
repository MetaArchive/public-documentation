A **Cache** or a **LOCKSS cache** is a server running the LOCKSS [daemon](https://confluence.educopia.org/display/MET/LOCKSS#LOCKSS-LOCKSSDaemon) software which participates in a LOCKSS network.

**Cache** means a dedicated server outfitted with the LOCKSS software (and any other required software as specified in the [MetaArchive Technical Specifications](/public-documentation/MetaArchive-Cooperative/How-MetaArchive-Works/Technical-Specifications)) for the sole purposes of testing, ingesting, and preserving MetaArchive Member collections. Often also referred to as MetaArchive-LOCKSS cache for the purposes of MetaArchive Cooperative documentation.
