Nagios
======

[Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/) is a software program that monitors systems, networks, and infrastructure.Â 

It is one of several tools used to assist with managing the MetaArchive LOCKSS network, including [Cache Manager](/public-documentation/MetaArchive-Cooperative/Knowledge-Base/Cache-Manager) and [Conspectus](/public-documentation/MetaArchive-Cooperative/Knowledge-Base/Conspectus).

Unlike the front-facing Cache Manager and Conspectus programs, Nagios is used primarily by MetaArchive Staff to monitor the network from the back-end.
