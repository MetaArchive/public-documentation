**Retired** (AU status) When a Content Provider decides to discontinue preserving an [archival unit](/public-documentation/MetaArchive-Cooperative/Knowledge-Base/Archival-Units-(AUs)) it is marked with the status ‘Retired’ in the [Conspectus](/public-documentation/MetaArchive-Cooperative/Knowledge-Base/Conspectus). When an AU is marked as “retired,” nodes no longer conduct [polling and voting](/public-documentation/MetaArchive-Cooperative/Knowledge-Base/Polling-and-Voting) on this AU. However, the AU continues to exist in the network. Only super users can assign the 'Preserved' and 'Retired' status.
