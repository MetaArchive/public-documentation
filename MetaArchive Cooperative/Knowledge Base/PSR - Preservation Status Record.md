PSR - Preservation Status Record
================================

A **Preservation Status Record (PSR)** tells members where their AUs are.Â  It's a screen in  [Conspectus](/public-documentation/MetaArchive-Cooperative/Knowledge-Base/Conspectus) that you see when you click on the number of copies for an AU.
