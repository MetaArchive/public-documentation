LOCKSS requires the inclusion of an **HTML Manifest Page** for each AU in the LOCKSS system.  This page records:

* Information about the content of the AU
* Contact information for the AU
* Permission for the LOCKSS daemons to crawl and harvest the content

This manifest page should be placed in the top-level directory (i.e., the base\_url):

It does not need to contain links to archival units like most standard manifest pages.  The template can be found here: <https://github.com/MetaArchive/educopia/blob/master/manifestpages/mabagitmanifest.html>

Here's an example of what a filled out HTML Manifest Page looks:
