**MetaArchive Preservation Network** or **Network** is the technical network and infrastructure of the MetaArchive Cooperative. It consists of preservation sites administered in geographically dispersed locations by Member organizations (at the sustaining and preservation membership levels). It stores content submitted by Members.
