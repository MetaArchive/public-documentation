PLN - Private LOCKSS Network
============================

MetaArchive is a **Private LOCKSS Network**, or PLN. 

There are several PLNs in existence.  See: <https://www.lockss.org/join-lockss/networks>

Additionally, there are quarterly meetings of the [Cross-PLN Technical Working Group](https://github.com/Cross-PLN-Technical-Working-Group), where members of various PLNs come together to discuss shared issues and concerns.  Meetings are open to all MA members.
