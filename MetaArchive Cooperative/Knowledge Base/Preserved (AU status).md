Preserved (AU status)
=====================

**Preserved** (AU status) This status indicates that testing is complete and the AU should be publicized to the production network for preservation. When an AU is marked as “preserved,” nodes will conduct [polling and voting](/public-documentation/MetaArchive Cooperative/Knowledge Base/Polling and Voting) on this AU to ensure its integrity over time.
