**Polling and voting** is the integrity ([fixity](/public-documentation/MetaArchive-Cooperative/Knowledge-Base/Fixity)) checking process by which LOCKSS nodes operating in a network conduct randomized polls over  [LCAP](/public-documentation/MetaArchive-Cooperative/Knowledge-Base/LCAP) to confer on the integrity values of co-preserved content. Polling and voting takes place on a continuous basis. 

After [Archival Units](/public-documentation/MetaArchive-Cooperative/Knowledge-Base/Archival-Units-(AUs)) have been ingested to the MetaArchive LOCKSS network via a staging server, the polling and voting system checks across storage nodes to make sure none of the files has changed.
